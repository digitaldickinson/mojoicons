# mojoicons
A few sketch style icons/illustrations that have a bit of a mobile journalism bias.
There are two files here. One is a PNG so the background is transparent. 
They are set out so they can be cropped square. So you could use this in something like Google slides and then crop around the one you want to use.  The other is a Photoshop(PSD) with the same layout.
Feel free to use them as you see fit. Let me know if you find them useful...@digidickinson on Twitter.
