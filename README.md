# mojoicons
A few sketch style icons that have a bit of a mobile journalism bias.
There are two files here. One is a PNG so the background is transparent. 
You could use this in something like Google slides and then crop around the ones you want to use.  The other is a Photoshop(PSD)with the same layout.
Feel free to use them as you see fit. Let me know if you find them useful...@digidickinson on Twitter.
